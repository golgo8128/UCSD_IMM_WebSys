<H2>Philosophy</H2>

<p>A "work chunk" is a work with a single purpose which is planned to be
done within a single time frame. The purpose of this system is to help
users to plan their work chunk and to assess how the users effectively
finished the works.</p>

<H2>Format of plan</H2>

<DD>General methodology used to accomplish this plan.</DD>
</DL>
