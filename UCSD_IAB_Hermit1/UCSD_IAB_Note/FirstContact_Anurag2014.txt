Hi Larkin and Rin,

Anurag will be with us as a volunteer for the next two weeks. He can help out in learning FreezerWorks and REDCap. I asked him to learn these two software items and help with sample organization and the logic behind it. He is a high school student who has an interest in software and bioinformatics.


He will also be working with us when he gets out of school during the summer months.

After he does his onboarding today he will be back at around 10 am. Rin and Yurong, could you show him the Freezerworks software and manual?

Thanks,
Kumar

Dear Anurag,

Sounds good. I can meet with you at 815 am at Stein Clinical Research Building Room 406. How will you be coming to UCSD, will your Mom be driving you?
If so, call me at 858-997-5322 when you arrive and I or one of my staff will meet you in the Stein Parking lot or Gilam Parking structure. I have a busy day tomorrow as a visiting professor is coming so I will be leaving around 915 am and only be back in the late afternoon.

You could meet Larkin and Rin tomorrow who can show you around the lab.

Kumar
