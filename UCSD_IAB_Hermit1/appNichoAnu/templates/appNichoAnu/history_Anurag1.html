<H1>History of HERMIT</H1>

This page briefly introduces the history of HERMIT.
Golgo's work record contains more detail
on the history, evidences of works
on this project with the high school student
in the university laboratory,
and estimated amount of time spent on this project.

<H2>Intensive data check</H2>

At the end of 2015, a large amount of efforts were
put into intensive data check.

<H2>Data collection</H2>

The data on metabolic pathways were input into Excel spreadsheet.

<H2>First sudden visit</H2>

The story of HERMIT started with the sudden visit of the high school student
at the beginning of Christmas break in 2014.

<H2>The basis - the proposed idea which had not been implemented for a while</H2>

<p>In 2011, Prof. Rebort Nauxvia described his idea on visualization of Nicholson's Metabolic
Pathway Chart. On October 20, 2011, we had a meeting with Prof. Chelsar Nelka, a famous
computer scientist to discuss the idea.</p>

<p>
On August 8, 2013, we had a meeting with Cytoscape developpers.
