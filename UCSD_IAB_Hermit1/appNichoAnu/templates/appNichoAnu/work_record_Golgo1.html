Subject: Checking edge information in your Nicholson spreadsheet
Date: Sun, 13 Dec 2015 13:04:50 -0800
</pre>

<p>Hi Anurag,</p>

<p>I further went through the Nicholson spreadsheet you created.</p>

<p>In particular, I have tried to match edge information which were
sampled and recorded roughly with your edge information.
The result is attached. Please see the column Check items. The meanings are follows:</p>

<table>
<tr>
<th align="left">Item name</th>
<th align="left">Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ID pair</td>
<td>The IMM ID pair does not appear in the Nicholson map or was not sampled</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ID pair orientation</td>
<td>The direction of the reaction does not match what appears in the sampled information.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>EC num</td>
<td>Discrepancy between your EC number and sampled EC number. If there are multiple EC numbers for a single pair, this check is unreliable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Reaction type</td>
<td>Discrepancy between your reaction type and sampled reaction type.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Color of reaction</td>
<td>Discrepancy between your color of reaction and sampled color of reaction.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>I am greatly concerned that so many discrepancies appeared.</p>

<p>It could be that most of your edge information are correct
and the discrepancies are due to the errors in the sampled information or my checking procedure.</p>

<p>So, to find the reasons of these huge amount of discrepancies,
could you carefully and faithfully check each of all edge information which have check items in the attached spreadsheet?</p>


Thanks,<br/>
Golgo

<p>Dear Golgo,</p>

<p>Thank you for letting me know about the IMM website. I am completely
comfortable with the decision. I am confused about
how there are so many discrepancies with the edge information. I am
<B>positive</B> that most of the information is correct.
</p>

<p>
With so many discrepancies, this will definitely delay the process for
publication. I will check all the edge information in the attached
spreadsheet.
</p>

<p>
Also, thank you so much for your feedback. I will let you know as soon =
as possible for all the corrections.
</p>


Sincerely,<br/>

I wanted to provide you an update on the project of mapping the Metabolic pathway.
I have finished quite a bit on the project for the Metabolic Pathways mapping that
I had initiated in the excel for Cytoscape under your guidance early this month.
(please find attached).
I am targeting to finish in the next 3 weeks in between my tests and my finals.

Hi Anurag, good job.
</p>

<p>
I briefly checked your spreadsheet.
I do not see much "Coupled reactions" in column I.
</p>

<p>
Will they be added later?

Good Morning. It's been a long time.
I wanted to let you know that I came inside the lab
to be here from Wednesday to Friday.
I just arrived 8:30 this morning.
Sorry for not giving you the heads up.
I will leave at 3:00 for all 3 days working 18 1/2 hours in the lab.
If you did not get this message earlier,
I sent an email to Dr. Armash letting him know that
I would be coming today until Friday. See you soon.

<p>
Good Morning. I would be interested doing the dry lab work in Dr. Armash's Lab under your guidance.
I am looking for some additional guidance on helping me get started on the preparation for dry lab work.
Is it possible for you to have a phone call with me about 30 minutes this week to provide me advice.
I am eagerly looking forward to assisting you in anyway dry lab work that you think that I will be able to help do.
</p>

<p>
I am looking forward to hearing from you.

Hi Arklin and Golgo,
</p>

<p>
Anurag will be with us as a volunteer for the next two weeks.
He can help out in learning FreezerWorks and REDCap.
I asked him to learn these two software items and help with sample organization and the logic behind it.
He is a high school student who has an interest in software and bioinformatics.
</p>

<p>
He will also be working with us when he gets out of school during the summer months.
</p>

<p>
After he does his onboarding today he will be back at around 10 am.
Golgo and Yulong, could you show him the Freezerworks software and manual?
</p>

<p>
Thanks,<br>
Maurk

<p>Sounds good. I can meet with you at 815 am at Stein Clinical Research Building Room 406. How will you be coming to UCSD, will your Mom be driving you?
If so, call me at ???-???-???? when you arrive and I or one of my staff will meet you in the Stein Parking lot or Gilam Parking structure. I have a busy day tomorrow as a visiting professor is coming so I will be leaving around 915 am and only be back in the late afternoon.

<H2>The basis - the proposed idea which had not been implemented for a while</H2>

<p>In 2011, Prof. Rebort Nauxvia described his idea on visualization of Nicholson's Metabolic
Pathway Chart. On October 20, 2011, we had a meeting with Prof. Chelsar Nelka, a famous
computer scientist to discuss the idea.</p>

<p>
On August 8, 2013, we had a meeting with Cytoscape developpers.
